  <h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>We have automated and controlled titration of Citric acid against Sodium Hydroxide. Considering our program, it can detect most color changes, however it does have it flaws. We used a magnetic stirrer so that the color settles or dissipates faster. It also needs an appreciable difference in the color that the solution turns to. For future scope we could add a stopwatch or timer to measure the duration of the reaction. Considering the large amount of distance the liquid drawn creates on the burette, we dropped our initial idea to photograph the start and end-points. We can implement temperature sensing and controlling more complex reactions. As it stands we have implemented controlling a burette and sensing color. Both these functionalities are implemented with PIO in the RP2040 QtPy.</p>
